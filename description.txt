//description.txt - a brief project explanation

Welcome to my Weather Forecast application! 

This is a project I developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 

which leverages the open weather app API to provide users with up-to-date weather information for their desired location.

Through the integration of this API, my application is able to provide accurate and reliable weather forecasts, showcasing 

my ability to integrate third-party APIs into my projects.

I developed this application to showcase my skills as a web developer, and to provide a useful and practical tool for individuals 

seeking up-to-date weather information. The application is designed with a simple and user-friendly interface, allowing users to 

quickly and easily access the information they need. I take pride in my work, and am committed to delivering high-quality products 

that exceed expectations. I believe that this project demonstrates my ability to develop complex and sophisticated web applications, 

while still maintaining a focus on usability and user experience.

Thank you for taking the time to review my project, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
