    <blockquote>
        SkyWatch is a weather forecast application that uses the OpenWeatherMap API 
        to fetch reliable and accurate weather data for any given location. 
        The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
        The application is hosted on GitHub Pages and can be accessed 
        <a href="https://aarnav1729.github.io/weather-forecast/" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        The application is designed with a simple and user-friendly interface. 
        Users can enter the name of any town, city, state, country, or locality and 
        the application will fetch the current weather conditions for their specified location. 
        The application is designed to be responsive, and will adapt to any screen size.
